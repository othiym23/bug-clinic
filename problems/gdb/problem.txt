gdb, and its next-generation descendent, lldb, are versatile, mature
tools that are also kind of terrible. However, when you need them,
there isn't really a good substitute, so here's how you do it when you
need to.

There is one common use case for gdb all with Node: your code triggers
a failure in one of the assertions in Node's C++ layer. In that case,
here's what you run:

    gdb `which node`
    run path/to/command.js <and> <other> <args>
    ...time passes, node crashes...
    thread apply bt all

or for lldb:

    lldb `which node`
    run path/to/command.js <and> <other> <args>
    bt all

This will give you a set of backtraces for all the active threads in Node
at the time the program crashed, which may be useful to Node developers
experienced with Node's C++ internals.

If you have coredumps turned on on your system (on most Unix systems,
this is done by running `ulimit -c unlimited` as the user that's going
to be running the process, and check your system's documentation for
where core files are stored), you can call process.abort() to cause
your Node process to dump core. The nice thing about core files is
that they support postmortem debugging: as long as you have the binary
for the version of node that crashed, and the coredump itself, you can
continue to poke around inside the core file.

A sad thing about GDB is that it will only play nice with Node if you
have a custom build of a recent version of Node that has support for
gdb / lldb explicitly built into it. You'll need to configure your Node
binary like so:

    ./configure --gdb --without-snapshot --debug

Using a binary debugger with a JIT is pretty tricky, but the V8 team
has anticipated this use case, and if you run your node processes with
the options `--gdbjit --gdbjit-full`, you'll get much more usable
stacktraces in both gdb and lldb. Do it like so (run from the root
directory of the Node build):

    gdb -d lib/ -d src/ --args ./node \
        --gdbjit --gdbjit-full /path/to/app.js

If you have access to a SmartOS vm, SmartOS's low-level debugger, mdb,
has recently been taught how to read core dumps from Linux. mdb is a
much more powerful and better-designed debugger than gdb / lldb, but
it is at least as challenging to learn, and the number of people who
have mastered it is probably in the low double figures.
