Node is a garbage-collected language, but that doesn't mean that it
doesn't leak resources. In fact, badly-written Node programs can
leak an astounding amount of memory. Figuring out where all that
memory can be a pretty major project. Turning on `--trace-gc` will
tell you many informative things about how the garbage collector
operates in practice, but aside from telling you at a very coarse
level whether your process's memory usage is growing over time, it's
not very useful.

The single best tool for capturing information about what's going
on with a Node process's memory is the heapdump package. It needs to
be explicitly included in your app, but once it's in there, you can
capture a snapshot of the heap either programmatically from you code,
or (similarly to the debugger) send the process SIGUSR2 using `kill
-SIGUSR2 <process id>`.

What do you do with those heapdumps? Since they're snapshots of the V8
heap, you just load them up in the Chrome Developer Tools, by going
to the Profiles tab, right-clicking in the tab pane, and selecting
"Load profile...". The UI is semi-self-explanatory. If you load two
snapshots, you can see the diff between them.

The best rule of thumb for gathering heap snapshots is to wait to
capture the first snapshot until the app has been running a few
minutes, so that all of the program code has loaded, the JIT has had
a chance to stabilize, and the process is in its steady operational
state. You want to capture a few heaps, because over time there
will be a fair amount of variance as the garbage collector runs.
Interpreting heap snpshots (especially when diffing them) is a bit of
a black art, and there's no substitute for practice.

By the time you've made it this far, though, you've already mastered a
few arcane arts, so you should be used to this by now, no?
