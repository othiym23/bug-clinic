Although it's not always possible, it can be incredibly satisfying to
just load part of your program into node and poke at it interactively.
The built-in node REPL (read-eval-print loop) is pretty bare-bones,
and working with it can be difficult (although it will occasionally
surprise you with what it does have, like on-demand loading of the
core modules, and tab-completion of variable and function names). It's
enough to use as a scratch pad and maybe pull in a module or two to
see how they work with various inputs, but you have to jump in and out
of it frequently as you make changes to your code, and it's kind of a
pain.

This is more or less the problem replpad was designed to solve. It
adds a huge number of additional features, including the ability to
watch source directories and reload files when they change, access
the documents for built-in functions directly from inside the REPL,
apply syntax highlighting to the result of calls, and add a grab-bag
of useful new commands to make working with sources easier.

Another very useful module, replify, will add a REPL to your
application, allowing you to connect to it via a Unix domain socket
*while the application is running*. This can be an invaluable tool for
diagnosing problems with long-running services (although, like a lot
of very useful debugging features, it's not necessarily safe for use
in production, so consult with your personal physician / offer void
where prohibited by law).

To install these modules, you'll need to `npm install replify` and
`npm install replpad` respectively.

If you really want to go through the wormhole to a magical world of
live application introspection, you can *combine replify and replpad*:

    // in your application
    var replify = require("replify");
    var replpad = require("replpad");

    var server = require("http").createServer(function (req, res) {
      res.end("hello");
    });

    replify({name : "hello-server", start : replpad}, server);

    server.listen(1234, function () {
      console.log("listening");
    });

Once you start that server, install `repl-client` and connect to the
running service:

    rc /tmp/repl/hello-server.sock
    // on Windows: rc \\.\pipe\tmp-repl\hello-server.sock

and you'll get connected to the replify'd replpad, where you can
type `app` and get the current state of your HTTP server! Whatever
object you pass to the call to replify is the `app` context in the
REPL, so you can pass it a database connection pool or HTTP agent for
making outbound requests and easily see the state of the service,
interactively, in realtime. MAGIC.

## CHALLENGE

So let's do that! Write a module that exports a function that takes
a callback, starts an HTTP server on port 8080 (that can reply with
whatever). The function should also use replify (and replpad, if you
feel like it) to expose an object that contains a property named
"__message" with the value "REPLs are neat" in its second argument.
The REPL should be named "bug-clinic" (include this somewhere in the
first argument).  When everything is running, it should call the
callback with the server and the replify instance as arguments.

The function should look something like the following:

    module.exports = scenario;

    function scenario(callback) {
      var createServer = require("http").createServer;

      var server = createServer(/* do HTTP response stuff here */);
      var repl = // do replify stuff here

      callback(server, repl);
    }
