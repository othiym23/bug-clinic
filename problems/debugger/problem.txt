Although you'd think a debugger would be the first tool to reach for
when you're talking about debugging, Node developers tend to not use
debuggers as much. There are a few reasons for this, but there are two
main reasons why using the Node debugger is difficult enough that most
people don't bother:

 * Node's dynamic module system means that you have to wait until a
   module has been require()d to set function-based breakpoints in it.
 * The Node event loop is implemented in such a way that it's
   impossible to step across ticks of the event loop.

It doesn't help that the debugger's UI is obtuse to the point of pain,
but once you learn a few commands, it's not so bad:

  * s - step in, or go to the next line in the program, stepping in to
        function calls. The second most useful debugger command.
  * <enter> - repeat the previous command. *The* most useful debugger
        command.
  * n - next command. Like `s`, without stepping into function calls.
  * o - step out, for when you're not interested in anything else happening in
        the current function.
  * c - continue. Just run until the next breakpoint or `debugger` statement
        is hit.

Speaking of the `debugger` statement, the key to efficiently using
the Node debugger lies in the `debugger` statement. It's basically
a breakpoint in code. When you've narrowed down roughly where the
issue is in your code, put `debugger;` into your code a few lines
*before* the troublesome line, so you can use the debugger REPL to
gather context. If you have a test case, it makes things much simpler.
This is a somewhat tedious process (and you should be careful to scrub
out your debugger statements when you're done -- jshint and eslint
will warn you about leftover debug statements, if you run them!), but
it's a lot easier than trying to deal with setting breakpoints.

To get to the debugger's REPL, just type 'repl' at the debugger prompt.

VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: to get out of the debugger REPL and back to the
debugger prompt, type 'ctrl-c' at the REPL prompt. The command-line
debugger is modal, which means that you can't use debugger commands in
the REPL and vice versa.

OTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: The debugger REPL is not as safe as one might
hope. Every variable that was in scope at the line where execution was
paused is visible to the REPL, which is sometimes the only way to see
what's going on inside a closure. However, *sometimes* (and it's not
always obvious when), trying to evaluate a variable in the REPL will
lock up the debugger so hard you have to kill the process from the
outside. This doesn't mean anything is wrong with your program, but it
does mean that you'll have to come up with another way of getting at
the information you want.

Another useful tip is that running `kill -SIGUSR1 <process id>` to a
node process will put it in debugger mode, so you can run `node debug
-p <process id>` on it from the outside. Think hard before doing this
against processes in production, though, because the Node debugger is
not super safe.
