MONITOR mentioned that Node does have some low-level built-in support
for logging. This is controlled with the NODE_DEBUG environment
variable, and is useful in situations in which you're uncertain about
how your code is interfacing with Node's internals. Using it is pretty
simple: just set NODE_DEBUG to a comma-delimited list of the names of
the modules you want to debug, like so:

    NODE_DEBUG=module,http node my-problem-app.js

The built-in modules that take advantage of this setting vary from
version to version of node, but at the time this was last updated,
the modules that use NODE_DEBUG to specify logging include 'cluster',
'net', 'http', 'fs', 'tls', 'module', and 'timers'. Be warned that the
log output varies from cryptic to incredibly verbose, but if you're
trying to do something fancy with the module system or understand
what's going on with your outbound HTTP requests, sometimes NODE_DEBUG
is a lifeline. To keep debug logging from being a drag on performance,
disabled NODE_DEBUG calls are mapped to a no-op function.

In older versions of Node NODE_DEBUG debugging was handled in an ad
hoc fashion, but in Node 0.11 (and presumably in Node 0.12), there
is a new function in the util module, `util.debuglog()` that you
can use in your own code (the next section of this workshopper will
discuss a more general way of doing this). If you want access to this
functionality and you're not yet running on Node 0.11, the `debuglog`
module is a simple backport of this functionality.

## CHALLENGE

To show you how it works, here's a simple HTTP client that has
something wrong with it:

    //  scan-client.js
    var request = require("http").request;

    var contentType = "text/html";

    var headers = {
      host : "localhost",
      port : 9876,
      method : "GET",
      headers : {
        "content-type"   : contentType,
        "content-length" : body.length,
        "requested-by"   : "Requestâ„¢"
      }
    };

    var yolo = request(headers, function (res) {
      res.setEncoding("utf8");
      res.on("data", function (data) {
        console.log("BODY: " + data);
      });

      res.on("end", function () {
        console.error("done!");
      });
    });

    yolo.end();


And here's a simple server to test it against:

    //  scan-server.js
    var createServer = require("http").createServer;
    var server = createServer(function (req, res) {
      res.end("hello");
    });
    server.listen(9876, function () {
      console.log("listening");
    });

If you run this server with `NODE_DEBUG=http node scan-server.js`, 
it will show you what's going on with the server, when you test it with 
the buggy `node scan-client.js`.  You can also see an example
server run by running `bug-clinic run scenario.js` -- it will be the
text at the top of the output run.

It should be pretty obvious what the problem is (a hint: look for the
word 'error'), and it will also be obvious when the problem has gone
away.
